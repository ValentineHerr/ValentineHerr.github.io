description: I had a lot of fun automating the creation of these Carbon cycle diagrams. They were originally drawn "by hand" in PowerPoint, only for tropical forest biomes (see the original version in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/gcb.13226">Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2016)</a>) but it became necessary to come up with a more efficient way when we expanded the analysis to all forest biomes and with growing data. The process involved writing my own function to draw power-point like arrows that would take their width based on the importance of the flux in the Carbon cycle. All of the data used for these plots are from the ForC database, led by Dr. Kristina Anderson-Teixeira. Kristina is also the talented artist that drew the background of the diagrams.
