description: I always enjoy the challenge of creating a beautiful and complex map in R. Here I had to recreate the left map, including the inlet figures after new data was added to the <a href="https://forc-db.github.io">ForC database</a>. The original picutre was created in a licensed GIS software and an image editing program, necessiting someone to redo the figure "by hand" everytime the data changed. Now my R script can be run to update the figure and the output looks like the right picture automatically.
